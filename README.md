#### 1. Setup Virtual Environment
We recommend creating a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
for running the server. 
```
python -m venv hophacks-env
```

For Windows:
```
.\hophacks-env\scripts\activate.bat
```

For Linux
```
source hophacks-env/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Install Requirements
Then install the requirements (with your virtual environment activated)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Running
Running Dev:
```
cd src
flask run
```
